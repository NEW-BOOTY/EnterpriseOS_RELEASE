# Multi-Cloud Governance Methodology

Enterprise-OS™ normalizes findings from:

  - google/chimera/cloud/cloud_integration.sh  (GCP)
  - apple/synergy/cloud/cloud_integration.sh   (Apple ecosystem endpoints)
  - oracle/veritas/cloud/cloud_integration.sh  (Oracle Cloud)
  - microsoft/sentry/cloud/cloud_integration.sh (Azure)
  - Additional connectors as configured.

Posture data is aggregated into governance reports under reports/*_governance_report.md
and can be surfaced via the enterprise-os-dashboard UI.
