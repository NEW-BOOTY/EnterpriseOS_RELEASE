Check 1: Outbound connections
  Command: netstat -tnp | grep -v 127.0.0.1
  Result: No established outbound TCP connections unrelated to loopback.

Check 2: DNS traffic
  Command: tcpdump -ni any port 53 -c 50
  Result: No DNS queries observed while Enterprise-OS™ baseline scenario executed.

Check 3: Cloud metadata access attempts
  Monitored endpoints:
    - 169.254.169.254 (AWS/GCP/Azure metadata)
    - 169.254.169.250 (Oracle)
  Result: No attempted connections.

Check 4: Telemetry endpoints in configuration and code
  Command: grep -R "https://" enterprise_os_root/ Enterprise-OS-COGNITIVE-v9/ google/ meta/ amazon/ oracle/ ibm/ microsoft/ openai/
  Result: No analytics or telemetry endpoints detected; only documentation links and local dashboard references.

Summary:
  Across the verification window, Enterprise-OS™ executed orchestration, SBOM/MBOM generation,
  and compliance evaluation without emitting external telemetry. All observed traffic remained
  on localhost where enabled.
