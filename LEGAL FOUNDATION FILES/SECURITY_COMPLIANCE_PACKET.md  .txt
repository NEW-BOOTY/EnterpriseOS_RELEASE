1. EXECUTIVE SECURITY OVERVIEW
Enterprise-OS™ was designed from the ground up as a secure-by-design, zero-telemetry, zero-dependency, offline-capable, and air-gap-ready system for:
Enterprise
Government
Defense
OEM vendors
Regulated industries
Critical infrastructure
Zero Trust architectures
Where traditional enterprise software struggles to meet security and compliance, Enterprise-OS™ eliminates massive categories of risk by design:
✔ Zero Telemetry
✔ Zero External Calls
✔ Zero Open-Source Dependencies
✔ Zero Supply-Chain Risk
✔ Zero Analytics
✔ Zero Cloud Reliance
✔ Zero Unauthorized Data Storage
These traits make Enterprise-OS™ one of the lowest-risk platforms available for secure environments.
2. SOC 2 SECURITY CONTROLS MAPPING
Enterprise-OS™ supports SOC 2 Type II alignment across:
Security (required)
Availability
Processing Integrity
Confidentiality
Privacy
✔ 2.1 Key SOC 2 Aligned Controls
SOC 2 Category	Enterprise-OS™ Control Alignment
Logical Access	RBAC, local-only authentication
System Operations	Deterministic execution, zero telemetry
Change Management	Controlled updates, digitally signed releases
Risk Mitigation	Hardened defaults, no dependency chain
Monitoring	Optional local logging, secure mode
Confidentiality	Air-gapped operation, no external data flows
Privacy	No personal data collection
✔ 2.2 SOC 2 Strengths of Enterprise-OS™
Deterministic execution reduces attack surface
No uncontrolled third-party code
No cloud infrastructure required
Full transparency of runtime behavior
No unknown analytics or “shadow data”
This satisfies all SOC 2 principles related to unauthorized data access and unauthorized data transfer.
3. NIST 800-53 REV. 5 SECURITY CONTROL MAPPING
Enterprise-OS™ aligns with NIST SP 800-53 (Moderate / High) including:
Control Family	Alignment
AC – Access Control	RBAC, least privilege, local isolation
AU – Audit & Accountability	Optional local signed logs
CM – Configuration Management	Immutable runtime modules
SC – System Communications	Zero external communications
SI – System Integrity	Integrity checks, signature verification
MP – Media Protection	Local-only data handling
PE – Physical Security	Compatible with SCIF environments
PL – Planning	Security documentation & governance
RA – Risk Assessment	Full risk model included
SA – System & Services Acquisition	COTS item under FAR/DFARS
SR – Supply Chain	No OSS, no dependencies, no external risk
IA – Identification & Authentication	Role-based identity enforcement
Enterprise-OS™ qualifies as a low-risk COTS technology under Federal and DoD standards.
4. NIST SP 800-171 (DFARS 252.204-7012) ALIGNMENT
Enterprise-OS™ is designed for safe use with Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
✔ Relevant Controls Met:
3.1 Access Control
3.2 Awareness & Training
3.3 Audit & Accountability
3.4 Configuration Management
3.5 Identification & Authentication
3.7 Maintenance
3.11 Risk Assessment
3.13 System & Communications Protection
3.14 System & Information Integrity
Enterprise-OS™’s zero-network posture ensures no unauthorized CUI transmission.
5. CIS CONTROLS v8 MAPPING
Enterprise-OS™ aligns strongly with CIS foundational security pillars.
CIS Category	Enterprise-OS™ Implementation
CIS 1 – Inventory	Minimal footprint, no external assets
CIS 2 – Software Inventory	Single controlled codebase
CIS 4 – Secure Configurations	Pre-hardened defaults
CIS 5 – Access Control	RBAC, privilege boundaries
CIS 6 – Logging	Optional local secure logging
CIS 7 – Email/Web Protections	Offline operation prevents abuse
CIS 8 – Malware Defenses	Reduced attack vectors
CIS 13 – Data Protection	No data transmission
CIS 14 – Boundary Defense	No external network operations
6. ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE MAPPING
Enterprise-OS™ fully supports Zero Trust principles:
✔ 6.1 Zero Trust Pillars
ZTA Pillar	Enterprise-OS™ Control
Identity	RBAC, explicit operator identity
Device	Local, host-bound execution
Network	No external network calls
Application	Minimal attack surface
Data	No outbound flows, user-controlled
Automation	Deterministic & modular workflows
✔ 6.2 Why Enterprise-OS™ is Zero Trust-Native
No implied trust boundaries
No hidden analytics or cloud APIs
No uncontrolled processes
Deterministic execution pipeline
Fully inspectable behavior
7. SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY (NO OPEN-SOURCE RISK)
Most enterprise breaches come from:
OSS dependency attacks
Dependency confusion
Supply chain tampering
Malicious packages
Enterprise-OS™ avoids all of this by having:
✔ 0 open-source packages
✔ 0 dependency downloads
✔ 0 external build sources
✔ 0 remote code execution points
✔ 0 cloud runtime requirements
✔ Fully proprietary, closed-loop architecture
This alone removes entire classes of vulnerabilities.
8. SYSTEM HARDENING BASELINES
Enterprise-OS™ supports:
✔ DISA STIG-aligned deployments
✔ CIS hardened OS images
✔ FIPS-validated crypto (if configured)
✔ Immutable runtime model
✔ Secure environment isolation
✔ SCIF/air-gapped compatibility
Optional deployment checklists include:
Secure configuration baseline
RBAC segmentation
Host OS hardening
Secure storage policies
Operator authentication controls
9. INCIDENT RESPONSE (Aligned to NIST 800-61)
Enterprise-OS™ supports IR workflows:
✔ Detection
No telemetry required; internal error signaling.
✔ Analysis
Local logs only; no external surfacing.
✔ Containment
Modular architecture limits blast radius.
✔ Eradication
No persistent malware exposure due to zero dependencies.
✔ Recovery
Easy rollback, deterministic behavior.
10. ENCRYPTION & CRYPTOGRAPHY
Enterprise-OS™ supports:
✔ AES-256
✔ SHA-256 / SHA-3
✔ Curve25519 (optional)
✔ RSA-2048/4096
✔ FIPS-approved modules (if configured)
Supports:
encryption at rest
encryption in transit
signing of artifacts
integrity verification
secure config sealing
