DoD / FedRAMP / NIST / DFARS / ITAR / FISMA High
© 2025 DEVIN BENARD ROYAL. All Rights Reserved.
1. PURPOSE
This Government & Defense Addendum (“Addendum”) supplements:
Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)
OEM License Agreement (OEM-LA)
Master Services Agreement (MSA)
Support & Maintenance Agreement
Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
for government, defense, intelligence, or regulated-sector use of Enterprise-OS™.
This addendum applies when the Client is:

a U.S. federal agency
a DoD branch (Army, Navy, Air Force, USMC, Space Force)
a defense contractor or subcontractor
an intelligence agency
a government-sponsored entity
a state/local government using regulated data
a foreign government (subject to export approval)
2. GOVERNMENT USE CLASSIFICATION
Enterprise-OS™ is provided as a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (“COTS”) technology under:
✔ FAR 2.101 – “Commercial Item”
✔ DFARS 252.227-7015 – “Commercial Computer Software”
✔ DFARS 252.227-7014 (Rights in Noncommercial Software) DOES NOT APPLY
✔ FAR 12.212 – Rights in Commercial Computer Software
Therefore:
Enterprise-OS™ is commercial, NOT Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)
The government receives ONLY the rights explicitly stated in the ELA
No unlimited rights, no government-purpose rights, no special rights are granted
3. SECURITY STANDARD ALIGNMENT
Enterprise-OS™ aligns with the following frameworks:
✔ NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (Moderate / High)
✔ NIST Zero Trust Architecture
✔ NIST SP 800-171 (DFARS 252.204-7012)
✔ FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Standards
✔ FedRAMP Low / Moderate (architecture-aligned)
✔ DoD Cloud SRG IL2–IL4 (architecture-aligned)
✔ DISA STIG principles
✔ CIS Benchmarks
✔ FISMA controls (Moderate)
Enterprise-OS™ includes no open-source components, eliminating:
inherited CVEs
GPL/OSS conflicts
dependency chain risk
supply-chain vulnerabilities
4. HANDLING OF FEDERAL INFORMATION
✔ NO telemetry
✔ NO cloud calls
✔ NO remote data processing
✔ NO external dependencies
Enterprise-OS™ is fully compatible with:
air-gapped networks
SCIF environments
DoD closed networks
classified systems (with proper approvals)
If Personal Data or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is processed, the terms of the Data Processing Addendum (DPA) apply.
5. CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION (CUI)
If Enterprise-OS™ is used to process CUI, including:
defense technical information
procurement-sensitive data
export-controlled information
for Official Use Only (FOUO) data
then:
all processing must be Controller-directed
all support artifacts must be sanitized by the Client
no CUI leaves the government network
Processor shall operate in offline support mode unless approved
6. FEDRAMP & CLOUD DEPLOYMENT CONDITIONS
Enterprise-OS™:
does NOT itself require FedRAMP authorization
is FedRAMP-compatible
can run inside FedRAMP-authorized cloud environments
may require additional controls if deployed on agency infrastructure
No outbound cloud calls ensures compliance with agency security controls.
7. EXPORT CONTROL & ITAR
Enterprise-OS™ may be subject to U.S. export laws:
✔ ITAR (22 CFR 120–130)
